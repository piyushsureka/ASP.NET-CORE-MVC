# ASP.NET-CORE-MVC

ASP.NET Core MVC is a rich framework for building web apps and APIs using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The advantage of .NET Core is, it can run on platforms like Linux and macOs apart from windows.Tightly coupled web applications (presentation logic and business logic are dependent on each other) require more coding efforts to accommodate any functional changes. ASP.NET Core MVC helps to create loosely coupled web applications which can accommodate changes with less coding efforts.
Model-View-Controller is an architectural design pattern for enterprise application development. It separates different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

In this we will specifically learn to
1.) Create layout to have a consistent look and feel in the application

2.) Create partial views that can be reused in different pages

3.) Create action methods to get response in different formats like pdf, json

4.) Create models and use data annotations to validate the user inputs

5.) Perform CRUD operations to manage persistent data

6.) Use simple and multivalued controls to bind data

7.) Use state management techniques to maintain data at user level on the client/server

8.) Apply filters to perform additional data processing on the results of action methods
